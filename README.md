# Find-a-Pet

Senior Design repo for group 9

## Getting Started

After cloning the repo, go ahead and enter the `server` and `web` directories in separate terminal windows in VSCode. Open two terminal windows in the server directory. This makes sense later.

In first the `server` window, run `yarn watch`, in the second run `yarn dev`, and in the `web` window, run `yarn dev` as well to get the development environment up and running.

Running `yarn watch` listens for changes to the server files and compiles them to the `server/dist` folder so the changes are live.
